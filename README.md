# PortfolioProject

The purpose of this project is to use Machine Learning to classify log data into benign and malicious. The dataset used for this project is available on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/solarmainframe/ids-intrusion-csv .

The model helps detect whether network activity is safe or potentially malicious. It does this by learning patterns from past data to make predictions about new, unseen activity.

A simple method called Naive Bayes was used for this project, which works by calculating probabilities to determine if an activity looks more like normal behavior or a cyberattack. To ensure the best possible performance, we fine-tuned the model by testing different settings.

The results showed that the model can accurately identify large portions of attacks with some mistakes. 

To further improve the model, more data could be incorporated. Different machine learning models could also be tested to see if better performance can be achieved.
